## Introduction

The Airbrite API is an ecommerce logic and storage engine designed to be an essential tool for any developer.

Our API is organized around REST and designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We support [cross-origin resource sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should remember that you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code). JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.

To make the Airbrite API as explorable as possible, accounts have test API keys as well as live API keys. These keys can be active at the same time. Data created with test credentials do not access live money.


## Getting Started

* The base endpoint URL is: `https://api.airbrite.io`
* All requests must be made over SSL
* To create new orders, you should setup your product first
* To process payments, you must connect to Stripe, which can be done in your account settings


## Authentication

Tokens are used to authenticate your requests. There are two sets of tokens (public and secret) for each environment (live and test). Public keys are used only on the client-side and will authenticate for only POST requests for Orders. Secret keys are used by your servers to make requests to the Airbrite API.

All endpoints require authentication. To authenticate with HTTP header, there are 3 ways you can set your header, where {ACCESS_TOKEN} is `sk_test_xxxxxx` or `sk_live_xxxxxx`.

1. Authorization: {ACCESS_TOKEN}
2. Authorization: Basic {BASE64_ENCODED_ACCESS_TOKEN}
3. Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}

Alternatively, you can authenticate via query string by simply adding `?access_token={ACCESS_TOKEN}` to any request.


## Organization

The API is organized by version of the API and resource: `/{VERSION}/{RESOURCE}`. The current version of the API is `v2`. For example, to reach the Products endpoint, you would access `/v2/products`. To access a resource with a specific ID, the route is `/{VERSION}/{RESOURCE}/{ID}`.

These resources have full [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) support:

* Products
* Orders
* Customers

These resources have read-only CRUD support:

* Events

The API also has a number of child resources (or subcollections). Child resources are accessible via the route `/{VERSION}/{RESOURCE}/{RESOURCE_ID}/{CHILD_RESOURCE}`. A specific resource can be accessed at `../{CHILD_RESOURCE}/{CHILD_RESOURCE_ID}`. 

Below are the parent and their respective child resources.

* Products
    + Events
* Orders
    + Payments
    + Shipments
    + Events
* Customers
    + Orders
    + Events
* Account
* Events
    + Webhooks


## Response Format

All responses return with a similar structure. Collections returns an array and single objects return an object. Here's an example:

__Response__

    {
      "meta": {
        "code": 200,
        "env": "test"
      },
      "paging": {
        "total": 7,
        "count": 1,
        "offset": 5,
        "limit": 1,
        "has_more": true
      },
      "data": [
        {
          "user_id": "522a72380ac3590000000001",
          "_id": "522e4eeccf84bd0000000007",
          "name": "Awesome Product",                    
          "sku": "awesome",
          "price": 1000,
          "created": 1378766572,
          "created_date": "2013-09-09T22:42:52.781Z",
          "updated": 1378766572,
          "updated_date": "2013-09-09T22:42:52.781Z",
          "description": null,
          "metadata": null
        }
      ]
    }

All collections accept pagination parameters and filters will respond with paging information about the collection. These are read from the passed in query string and can be mixed and matched as necessary.

__Endpoint__

    GET https://api.airbrite.io/v2/products?limit=10&skip=5&sort=sku&order=asc

__Arguments__

    limit:  optional
            Maximum number of objects to return. Defaults to 100.
    skip:   optional
            Number of objects to skip over before returning results
    sort:   optional
            Which field to sort by
    order:  optional
            Which way to sort (1 or -1 and asc or desc are the same, respectively)
    since:  optional
            Matches all items updated after unix timestamp
    until:  optional
            Matches all items updated before unix timestamp

__Response__

    { 
        ...,
        "paging": {
            "total": 45,
            "count": 10,
            "offset": 5,
            "limit": 10,
            "has_more": true
        },
        "data": {
          ...  
        }
    }


## Errors

Airbrite uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, a payment failed, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Airbrite's servers.

Our error responses have the format: 

    {
        "meta": {
            "code": 400,
            "error_message": "User with email already exists.",
            "error_type": "client_error"
        },
        "data": "User with email already exists."
    }

### Create Order

__Note:__ If you'd like to add line_items, your product needs to be already created.

__Assigning an Order to an existing Customer__

If you want to assign the Order to an existing Airbrite Customer record at the time of creation, make sure to include the "customer" connection with the customer `_id`:

    {
        "customer": {
            "_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        }
    }

If you want to create a new Airbrite Customer record at the time of creation, include the "customer" connection and do not include an `_id`:

_This can also include additional properties you would like to associate with the customer..._

    {
        ...,
        "customer": {
            "name": "Kanye East",
            "email": "kanye.east@west.com",
            "card_token": "tok_xxxxxxxx",
            "metadata": {
                "gender": "male",
                "occupation": "rapper"
            },
            ...
        }
    }

__Note:__ The `card_token` property allows you to assign and save a Stripe tokenized credit card to the Customer. This will create a Stripe customer object, which allows you to perform recurring charges and track multiple charges that are associated with the same customer.

__Attaching a Payment at the time of Order creation:__

_If using Stripe, the payment card must be tokenized with `stripe.js` before the order is created._

You can immediately attach a Payment to the newly created Order by including the "payments" connection. There are 3 way to create a Payment:

    1) One-time-use Stripe Charge using a tokenized credit card
    2) Use the default Credit Card belonging to the Airbrite Customer on the Order
    3) Use a specific Credit Card belonging to the Airbrite Customer on the Order

_When creating a Payment, you have the option of capturing funds immediately or placing an authorization on the payment card. If capture is not specified, it will default to capturing funds immediately._

    __capture__ has 3 possible values: charge, auth, hold
        charge - immediately capture the charge
        auth - place an authorization on the charge
        hold - no-op, this just creates a stub payment allowing you to charge or auth at a later time

_Examples_:

1) At order creation, use a one-time-use card token and capture funds immediately

        {
            ...,
            "payments": [{
                "gateway": "stripe",
                "amount": 1337,
                "currency": "usd",
                "capture": "charge",
                "card_token": "tok_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
            }],
            ...
        }

2) At order creation, place an authorization on the __default card__ belonging to the customer (will drop off after ~7 days unless captured)

        {
            ...,
            "payments": [{
                "gateway": "stripe",
                "amount": 1337,
                "currency": "usd",
                "capture": "auth"
            }],
            ...
        }

3) At order creation, place a hold (stub payment) on a __specific card__ belonging to the customer

    {
        ...,
        "payments": [{
            "gateway": "stripe",
            "amount": 1337,
            "currency": "usd",
            "capture": "hold",
            "customer_card_token": "card_XXXXXXXXXXXX"
        }],
        ...
    }

## Events

Events are our way of letting you know about something interesting that has just happened in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new event object. For example, when a payment is successfully charged, we create a order.payment.succeeded event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple events to be created.

Like our other API resources, you can retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API. We also have a system for sending the events directly to your server, called webhooks. Webhooks are managed in your account settings.

### Types of events

This is a list of all the types of events we currently send. We may add more at any time, so you shouldn't rely on only these types existing in your code.

You'll notice that these events follow a pattern: resource.event. Our goal is to design a consistent system that makes things easier to anticipate and code against.

__Events__

* customer.created
* customer.updated
* order.created
* order.updated
* order.payment.succeeded
* order.payment.authorized
* order.payment.captured
* order.payment.refunded
* product.created
* product.updated
